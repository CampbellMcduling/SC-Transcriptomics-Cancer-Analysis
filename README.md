# SC-Transcriptomics-Cancer-Analysis
This repository houses the files for the single cell transcriptomics project, where we use multivariate statistical methods and (un)supervised machine learning to classify cells at a single cell resolution.

NOTE: This repository was created after the project had been completed.
